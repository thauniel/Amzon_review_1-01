{"reviews": ["I want to give this one 5 stars. It works great. It holds well over 1 gallon of water. It operates for a long time. I just want it to put a little more moisture in the air. I'm in Tucson so with this working I do not wake feeling over dry, nauseated and sinus sick. That's good. But, if I go outside for a bit and walk back into the room where it's been running all day it doesn't FEEL super humid like other units have even on High full time. I've had units in the past of the same size and similar design where you walk in the room and it feels like a swamp. Not this one."], "reference": [8 ], "score": [-0.10000000149011612]}
