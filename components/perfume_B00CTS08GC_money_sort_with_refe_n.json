{"reviews": ["Another AMAZING kock-off! I'm quite literally amazed at how close this stuff is to FIERCE. I figured I'd try it for $10.00. NEVER will I buy A&F again...this is just too close a knock-off to pay that extra money. YOU WILL NOT be disappointed.", "First off I read some of the reviews on this item.  It is supposed to be a Abercrombie and Fitch knock off of Fierce which is the best smelling cologne for men ever made.  Fierce is a very strong fragrance, spray it on in the morning and it's still with you at night.  I didn't expect this Enforce to be exactly like Fierce, but maybe something close or in the range of, but it is nothing like it.  I read and people said it smelled exactly like it, but I'm telling you these people have never worn Fierce if they really wore it before.  Enforce is very weak, it must be mostly water.  I didn't spend much on it at all, but that was actually too much spent for this.  I wouldn't waste my money.  If you want to have the great smell of Fierce, you're going to have to break down and pay the high price for it like I did."], "reference": [3, 0], "score": [-0.5, -0.30000001192092896]}
