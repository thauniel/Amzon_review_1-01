{"reviews": ["Missing a piece of rubber on bottom and didn't work , water came  out the bottom.", "I really was hoping this humidifier would work out for our baby’s nursery. It started out fine. I like that it’s a pour into design and once you get the hang of the controls it’s pretty easy to use. It was important for me to find a humidifier that had an auto shutoff, and this does. Where the problem comes in is that it auto shuts off before the water has fully run out and when it does, it flashes red and makes a beeping sound. That makes this not a great option for the nursery because it could wake up the baby. And with the water left over, it’s enough that I’d need to unplug the whole unit  and dump it out every day which is not ideal. Kind of bummed."], "reference": [0, 0], "score": [-0.800000011920929, -0.19375000288709998]}
