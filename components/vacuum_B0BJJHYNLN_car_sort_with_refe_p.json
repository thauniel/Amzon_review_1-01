Battery life is sufficient to clean entire car. Small size gets in all the tight crevices", "To be honest I have had handheld vacuums that had much more suction power than this one. Not saying that I need it to be super strong but, this one was definitely kind of weak even.

At first use I found it very easy to use not very loud.. it has just the right suctioning power. One of the good things about this is that it plugs into a USB port, which Iâ€™m finding a lot of equipment nowadays is using.. The vaccum charged pretty fast within 20 minutes. I would say Iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™s full power, but it was enough to get me started. The charge provided me the ability to vacuum my entire car without powering down, so I would say the 20 minutes was ample enough charge. If youâ€™re looking for something lightweight and easy to handle this is definitely for you.", "Why on this green Earth did I wait so long to get one of these?!?!
