{"reviews": ["[[VIDEOID:860f5697cf0acab0f76d8da25187af0d]] This slim handheld vacuum is a real winner in my book. It fits  easily in your hand, and with it's slim design it will get into tight areas that a regular dust buster or bigger vacuum just can't. Clean your car, spills in your kitchen, and in those hard to clean areas like under cabinets, or the fridge.  It charged up in a few hours and was cleaning up, and with those two speeds, it can get the crumbs and dust sucked up for you. This is a real winner in my eyes.", "The suction is very weak, even on the highest setting. The product itself is smaller than it appeared as advertised. It's very difficult to clean and doesn't hold much dust, dirt, etc. It's not worth the price. I could have gotten one at Walmart for half the price and better functionality.", "No power . Even little things canâ€™t clean dust", "Received used or refurbished item. Box was taped (poorly) with packing tape and the suction nozzle had dust inside of it. Other evidence of use (scuffs) here and there."], "reference": [1, 1, 0, 0], "score": [-0.20000000298023224, -0.800000011920929, -0.10000000149011612, -0.20000000298023224]}
