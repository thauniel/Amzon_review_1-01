{"reviews": ["Bought primarily as a bacon cooker.  It only has room for 4 pieces of bacon.  Also, the bacon cooks in it’s own grease.  The instructions said that it was dishwasher safe, but when I got it out of the dishwasher, the lid didn’t fit any more.", "I tried to make bacon in the microwave. It melted! - the dish not the bacon - It was then unrecognizable. I returned it. It also retained the smell of the bacon even after my repeated attempts to clean it.", "It melted the first time we tried to cook bacon. It only took 4 minutes to melt this way. What a horribly designed product!! This is definitely not safe, and it should be pulled from the market.", "This is not good for cooking bacon.  The lid allows the steam and grease ti escape around the edges of the lid.  It really messes up your microwave.  It is easy to use and easy to clean so we will keep it for a casserole dish."], "reference": [5, 5, 5, 1], "score": [-0.07500000298023224, -0.07500000298023224, -0.10000000149011612, -0.4000000059604645]}
