I like the idea of having a &#34;clean&#34; natural smelling perfume but this scent definitely is not.", "I mean, I *get* it: Warm Cotton. I sampled it in a store and thought, \"Oh my goodness, this smells amazing. So...familiar.\" Well, of course it does! Save yourself the money and just use fabric softener in your laundry! Smells just like fabric softener so why bother spending $xx on perfume? Just spend the five bucks on Downy or Febreze.<br /><br />Bottom line: not worth it."], "reference": [1, 1], "score": [-0.20000000298023224, -0.10000000149011612]}
