{"reviews": ["Simple set up, high capacity reservoir, cool light color options, variable mist options, all in a compact unit. The video shows mist set at high and revolving light colors. There are also a low mist setting and a sleep mode (low mist/no lights). I counted 9 colors (pink, purple, blue, turquoise, green, lime, yellow, orange, red). When your fav color appears, hit the light button to switch from color cycling to constant chosen color. I added a few drops of essential oil and the scent was diffused within a couple of minutes. A low humming sound is constant. Iâ€™m a light sleeper and will place humidifier on other side of bedroom.", "I have used the expensive Canopy humidifiers, Walmart, Vicks, all of the majors and this humidifier outweighs all the rest! It is the most simple to use - you can just pour into the top. It is so easy to keep clean by simply wiping down one single part and this bad boy can humidify my master and still have enough water for the next night. If you are comparing, look no further. This is it. Its got great settings and the lights can turn off.", "It the best the lights  are the best cleaning is very easy easy time use"], "reference": [2, 1, 0], "score": [0.10000000149011612, 0.6000000238418579, 0.800000011920929]}
