{"reviews": ["This product is ok for one person to use, but not for a family. I was disappointed that it started to  melt in the microwave after two uses, and I found red plastic stuck to my bacon.<br />The quality and crispiness of the bacon was great, and very tasty until part of the product melted.", "I really wanted to purchase this product. It looks amazing but I noticed several reviews mentioned no instructions. Before purchasing I went on the Kitalma website and downloaded their cookbook. It shows you how to cook some specific recipes but no general instructions like how to cook rice, how much water and rice, how long to cook. The product info just says make sure it's done. No instructions on how to cook popcorn, just that you can, What kind of popcorn, oil or no, how long to cook it. You can bake brownies, and cook bacon. How? Very disappointed. I removed it from my cart and ordered a microwave rice cooker that doesn't claim to do as many things but gives you instructions for the things it does do.", "Made bacon. There was no instructions, so I guessed on time.  5 minutes, and I had great crispy bacon ... and a melted insert.  :(", "Works exactly as advertised. First thing I did was try it on bacon. It came out crispy with none of the fat. Worked great on chicken and barbecue ribs as well. Quickly became one of my favorites.", "Chicken breasts and bacon done in minutes!"], "reference": [9, 6, 5, 4, 0], "score": [0.20000000298023224, 0.20000000298023224, 0.3250000048428774, 0.10000000149011612, 0.699999988079071]}
