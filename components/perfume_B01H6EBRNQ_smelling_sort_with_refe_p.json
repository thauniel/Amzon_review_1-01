{"reviews": ["I love this scent! I am constantly being complimented on how wonderful and light this scent is.  In the mornings people say my area smells like \"fresh\" clean air.  They love the scent and I ask if it's too much since we're all different and find certain smells offensive or too much.  But everyone loves it and is always complimenting on it. My family and co-workers say the scent is like fresh clean air/laundry hung out to dry/clean linens/towels.  If you like soft light clean smelling clothes you'll love this scent.  Doesn't last though."], "reference": [0], "score": [0.4000000059604645]}
