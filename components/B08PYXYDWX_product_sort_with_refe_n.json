{"reviews": ["Not a good product. Do not believe the reviews.", "The opening is so tiny that this product is useless", "[[VIDEOID:713bdffd462ed739e0e5d0e43d0ae9ea]] I am so disappointed with this product. I checked the reviews and thought, \"hey this can't be bad, it has great reviews\". I was very wrong. It stopped working midway into a light car cleaning session and I thought ok, maybe the battery is dead. So I cleaned the vacuum (there are little areas where dust/debris settles and they just wont come out) and washed the filter. I then went inside to charge it and the charging light flashed red for a second then went straight to blue. It won't charge no matter what nor will the vacuum turn on. I can't find any help online and the included manual has no information for this problem. I have wasted my money. This thing was only used and charged twice smh. So my one advice is DO NOT BUY.", "Stopped working after just 2 five-minutes usages! Called Amazon, they failed to accept return. Does not hold charge, turns off every 2-4 seconds. Tried charging it all day, still doesn’t stay on. Purchased the item only 3 weeks. Absolutely terrible product!", "I loved the looks of this hand-held vac abd was really excited about using it.  I’d use it for 5 minutes, and suction power was less than I expected, and then needed to be charged. It quit being able to charge altogether and was unusable about three weeks after I bought it.<br />I called customer service and they sent me another hand vac.  This unit was not better than the first.  This one must be charged after every use and has barely suction.  It quit being able to charge today:<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this product!"], "reference": [3, 0, 0, 0, 0], "score": [-0.699999988079071, -0.30000001192092896, -0.8999999761581421, -0.800000011920929, -0.800000011920929]}
