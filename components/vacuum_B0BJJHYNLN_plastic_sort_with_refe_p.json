{"reviews": ["The pros of this hand-held vac are its strong suction and a useful assortment of accessories. It’s user friendly; easy to empty and clean the basket; and light weight. It worked very well for picking up a good number of paper fragments from a paper shredder which I accidentally spilled onto the carpet in my office. It did a fine job for various small projects such as picking up crumbs, dust, and wood shavings as a result of drilling some holes.<br /><br />However, there are some cons. It is constructed using what feels like a thinner plastic, so it can feel a bit fragile even if it is made well enough to hold up to frequent use. For charging, it uses a special USB cable with a barrel connector for the vacuum side of the cable rather than using a USB connector for the vacuum side. There is no charge indicator on the vacuum that indicates when it is charged. Instead, the USB Type A side of the charging cable is encased in a small housing that contains an LED that glows RED when it needs a charge and changes to GREEN when fully charged. You are locked into using the cable that comes with the vacuum to check the charge status and to indicate its charged state. For me this is a major inconvenience and a poor design.<br /><br />The suction part of the vacuum works well but the electrical design for charging is old school. Evaluating this reasonably priced vacuum for its suction capability - its intended purpose - and the included useful accessories I’m giving it 4-stars. I will update should my rating change."], "reference": [0], "score": [0.152]}
