{"reviews": ["I got mine through a marlboro game thing not amazon but I absolutely love them. Battery life is great. They last forever. Bass is good. Make sure u download the jbl app also to get more features. I'm actually thinking about saving up my marlboro points to buy another pair to have as backup.", "The good sound of jbl I used to know and the noise canceling works well too.  Really good price. Comfortable to wear.  very satisfied.  Much more satisfying than the very expensive and breakable Bose.  what more do i want?", "Awesome sound quality, noise cancellation, superb bass, and awesome jbl warranty and product"], "reference": [2, 0, 0], "score": ["0.20000000298023224", "0.800000011920929", "0.8999999761581421"]}
