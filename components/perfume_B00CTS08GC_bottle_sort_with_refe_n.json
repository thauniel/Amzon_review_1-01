{"reviews": ["I am giving this a two star because I purchased this, it came super FAST....BUT when I opened the box there was a strange smell. When I sprayed the cologne itself, TERRIBLE...it had no SMELL AT ALL. So being that it is a cologne you can’t return it..luckily I messaged Amazon and they went above and beyond and sent me a new one free of charge... AMAZON GETS 5* all the way..and is why this cologne even got two stars. Once I receive the 2nd cologne i wasn’t impressed it had the same weird smell on the bottle itself and the smell of the cologne was stronger but it only lasted maybe 10 minutes. I wouldn’t recommend buying even at this price point.", "I had previously tried the Acqua di Gio Cologne by this company from the local walmart and I have to say that impression had great sillage, projection and longevity not to mention it really did indeed smell like Acqua di Gio. However, Abercrombie's Fierce is one of my favorite fragrances of all time so I really wanted to try this out. Needless to say this satisfied my expectations. The fragrance has good sillage, great projection, and 5+ hour longevity. The only downside is that I wish that they offered a 6.7 oz bottle! It is a very good investment of 10 dollars rather than paying about a 100 for the original Fierce.", "This has as great scintillation as the original! Great job Belcam! Also, ordering here, you don't incur the $21 UPS shipping of 1 bottle as you would normally on their site!!!"], "reference": [6, 2, 0], "score": [-0.30000001192092896, -0.20000000298023224, -0.10000000149011612]}
