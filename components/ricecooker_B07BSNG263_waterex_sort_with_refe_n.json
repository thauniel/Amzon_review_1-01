{"reviews": ["I’m shocked that someone could sell a product in the US with instructions that are filled with spelling and grammatical errors. The makers didn’t even bother having someone proof read it. Oh, aside from these errors they also make no sense!<br /><br />Here’s what I learned by trial and error:<br />(1) for up to 4 cups of rice, use a half cup more of water ex. 3 cups rice to 3.5 cups water. For over 4 cups of rice, use one cup more water ex. 5 cups rice, 6 cups water.<br />(2) for 4 cups of rice I use 1/3 cup of oil. Whatever you do, do not go by their recommended oil usage of whatever this thing “salad oil” is called. You’ll end up with super oily rice! I use half blend of avocado and olive oil which is a pale colored oil and not super heavy. Works great.<br />(3) I cook 4 cups of rice for 60-min and the tahdig (crispy bottom) comes out perfectly.<br />* Add 20 more minutes for more than 4 cups<br />* Do not stir the rice, you’ll break it and it won’t come out perfectly. Maybe one light stir but no more is needed.<br />(4) when there’s about 10 minutes left and you don’t see any more water, pour in your saffron<br /><br />The lid does not have a rubber seal so the whole time it whistles which can definitely be improved upon. Other than that it works once you actually get the hang of it."], "reference": [28], "score": [-0.07500000298023224]}
