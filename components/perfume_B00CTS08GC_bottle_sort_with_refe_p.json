{"reviews": ["I had previously tried the Acqua di Gio Cologne by this company from the local walmart and I have to say that impression had great sillage, projection and longevity not to mention it really did indeed smell like Acqua di Gio. However, Abercrombie's Fierce is one of my favorite fragrances of all time so I really wanted to try this out. Needless to say this satisfied my expectations. The fragrance has good sillage, great projection, and 5+ hour longevity. The only downside is that I wish that they offered a 6.7 oz bottle! It is a very good investment of 10 dollars rather than paying about a 100 for the original Fierce.", "This has as great scintillation as the original! Great job Belcam! Also, ordering here, you don't incur the $21 UPS shipping of 1 bottle as you would normally on their site!!!"], "reference": [2, 0], "score": [-0.20000000298023224, -0.10000000149011612]}
