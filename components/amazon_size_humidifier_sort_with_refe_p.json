{"reviews": ["The 40-hour run-time sold me. Also, the ability to check the fluids in the tank too. There are so many different reasons why this humidifier is much better than others. It is easy to use, easy to fill, is a nice size, has a night light, and you can use your essential oils with it. It seems relatively quiet, but I have never minded the sounds of a water filtering through a humidifier. I find it soothing. These are great to have around when you need them and this one is a keeper.", "My granddaughter loves it! Lovely colors and efficient. Just the right size.", "This is a good size as far as humidifiers go - it holds a LOT of water... While I like the size, I still change out the water for every use since I add essential oils to mine at night.", "The humidifier's compact size makes it suitable for various spaces. Its operation is relatively quiet, ensuring minimal disruption. Furthermore, the humidifier features an automatic shut-off function, which is beneficial for forgetful individuals. Its performance is highly effective in maintaining the desired humidity level in a room, and it operates without any leakage issues.", "I ordered this when my old humidifier stopped working in my plant room.  It's smaller than the 5L that I had, but it still puts out a very nice mist, and rather high output for it's size.  I really like it, even if I'll have to refill it more often."], "reference": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "score": [0.800000011920929, 0.6000000238418579, 0.4000000059604645, 0.30000001192092896, 0.30000001192092896]}
