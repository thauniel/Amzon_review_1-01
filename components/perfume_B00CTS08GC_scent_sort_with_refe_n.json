{"reviews": ["It reeks of that cheap alcohol in the beginning, then dries to a sort of citrus fresh scent, like Niko's Sculpture. People were right when the say it smells like the mall.  It does not really project and stays very close to the skin. Sander By Jil Sander smells  a bit stronger, darker and a bit  more complex,, suited better as an all around versatile scent for a man which can be worn day or night. At this price range, I would suggest you skip this and go for Aspen By Coty or Vicky Tiel Ulysse,  they are, IMHO, stronger better scents, leave this one for the teens."], "reference": [0], "score": [-0.05000000447034836]}
