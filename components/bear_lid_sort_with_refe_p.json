{"reviews": ["We have a wood burner and needed a humidifier to help our respiratory system stay moist.  This product does help.  My hubby also purchased a gauge to let us know the temp and humidity level in the room.  It has definitely been a help.  The amount of humidity can be knob controlled and the direction of the mist is also controllable.  Downside:  We use it 24/7 so it needs filled a lot.  The good part is that you can fill from the top and the lid is open enough that it is easy.  Another downside is the condensation inside the plastic unit that holds water gets so thick you can't see the water line level or the mark showing where to stop!  I would buy again though as it does help us!", "I love that this humidifier is an EASY top fill. Nothing to flip over or unscrew, just lift the square lid and pour your distilled water in! It's absolutely silent and has various settings for output. You should clean monthly to prevent mildew, as with any humidifier. I found this MUCH easier to clean than others I've had. I have 2 of these now for different rooms. Highly recommend this one!", "It’s got a dial to control the mist output, that’s a nice feature. Sturdy and low profile so it hopefully can’t get knocked over by cats . The cats could flip off the top lid though! Would recommend."], "reference": [1, 1, 0], "score": [0.6000000238418579, 0.30000001192092896, 0.10000000149011612]}
