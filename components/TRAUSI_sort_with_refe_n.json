{"reviews": ["I don't like things going in my ear because I've always had ear issues. These will be nice and comfortable and easy to use. They're subtle and open ear so I can also hear what's going on around me. I like them a lot", "These headphones are better than expected. It's hard to find good earbuds that don't actually go into your ear. The sounds is great and it has alot of features where you don't physically need your phone to play/pause or skip a song. They seem pretty sturdy I like that the case charges the headphones automatically."], "reference": [0, 0], "score": [-0.20000001043081284, -0.10000000149011612]}
