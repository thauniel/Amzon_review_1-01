{"reviews": ["Love the color!  Very sturdy and high output. This made such a difference when I had a cold and my skin is grateful for the extra moisture too. Love it!", "I love this product because you can turn up and down the way that the moisture comes out. It’s an easy fill container. You can also use essential oil in the little compartment. They tell you to put it in and I believe it works. Amazingly I first bought it because I kept having bloody noses because my air was so dry and since I’ve had it, I haven’t had any blood you noses, so I would definitely recommend it", "I really like my new humidifier. Being able to see the vapor it puts in the air makes me feel like it’s really helping the dryness in my house. It has really helped with the static shocks I was getting by adding more moisture in my house. Runs pretty quiet too and was a good price.", "great moisture!  i will order another for the baby room.  looks as pictured.  easy to clean and there is a lot of moisture which is great.  does not ruin the dresser it sits on.", "Would definitely buy again. This had a large capacity but doesn't appear bulky and an eye sore in the room. Produces great moisture in the air and whether on low or high its evident the moisture is being released... you can see it and feel it."], "reference": [2, 2 , 1 , 1 , 0], "score": [0.800000011920929, 0.699999988079071, 0.6000000238418579, 0.8999999761581421, 0.30000001192092896]}
