{"reviews": ["i charged this up when i received it 2 weeks ago. I have used it a bit over the last couple weeks and it hasn't needed a recharge yet. I spilled coffee grounds on the floor, and boom it was gone. I live in a very dusty environment so this baby has done wonders. I am very impressed with this unit as usually when I buy lower priced items like this they don't work well, this one has exceeded my expectations!", "I was surprised by the small size. It has fairly good suction for picking up crumbs and lint, but I don't think it would be useful for  bigger cleanups. The cylindrical shape means that every time you set it down on a surface it rolls away. Tonight I set it down on the kitchen counter. It rolled away, fell off the counter, hit the floor and spilled dirt all over. The on-off switch is also in an awkward place. It is on the underside of the handle, which means it is way too easy to accidentally turn it off and on while vacuuming. You also have to remove the end part of the vac every time you want to set it in its stand and/or recharge it.  This hand vac is okay, but not great."], "reference": [17, 9], "score": [-0.20000000298023224, -0.30000001192092896]}
