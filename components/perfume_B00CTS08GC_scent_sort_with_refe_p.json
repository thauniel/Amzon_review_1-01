{"reviews": ["I don't know where I originally bought this, Wal-Mart maybe...or Dollar General....not sure, but I have not been able to find this fragrance except on Amazon of course! This is a nice scent for a man. My husband wears it and it makes me want to jump his bones so buy it if you want someone to jump your bones once in a while.", "Smells just like the real thing, but is mostly alcohol based, so the sent only lasts about 3 hours before it disappears. The sent is lighter than the original, so I usually spray about 3 sprays on the front of my shirt. I like that there are no harsh notes that bother my allergies, like with other copy scents. I use this sent in mostly warm weather and get complements almost everywhere I wear it. If you have never smelled this scent, just pass within 50 feet of an  Abercrombie & Fitch store and you'll know, LOL", "Very cheap product, definitely smells watered down even for the price it's not worth it. The scent last about 5 minutes. You're better off buying the real thing at Abercrombie.", "Great strong scent. As advertised smells similar to fierce.", "An 8th of the cost of original A&F Fierce with the same great scent!", "Definitely a good replica; scent does not last long compared to the original though. Personally I have to spray myself a good 4-6 times to get a &#34;decent&#34; stick. Not enough to keep it on me for over 2-3 hours."], "reference": [7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "score": [0.699999988079071, 0.30000001192092896, 0.20000000298023224, 0.800000011920929, 0.5, 0.4000000059604645]}
