{"reviews": ["I got these for my 14 year old and she loves them. They work great to use while on the bus headed to games. Battery life is good. Great quality for the price paid. The comfort took time getting use to wearing them due to being use to something digging in her ears. Connected great with her iPhone 13. The sound quiz great as well.", "I was surprised at the quality! Headphones are sturdy. Don’t fall out of your ears AND volume is pretty loud! I think it’s a great product for the value! Mine were already fully charged.", "This product is really easy to use and connect to the Bluetooth! They fit good in your ears and are not uncomfortable to wear! They are very sleek and high quality! They take a quick charge and stay charged for  a while! They are very durable and would be a good option for someone who is active", "The sound quality is crystal clear with deep bass and balanced treble, making music and calls sound fantastic. Shipping was incredibly fast, and the earbuds arrived in perfect condition. They fit comfortably and the battery life is impressive. Highly recommend these if you're looking for great quality at a reasonable price!", "I enjoy how effortlessly they attach to my iPhone 14 Pro and how long they last. They also sound amazing and have great quality", "Open Ear Headphones, Bluetooth Ear Buds 5.3 Wireless Earbuds with LED Digital . Great quality , great sound, great quality", "These things are great amazing sound quality and very comfortable connected to my phone easy.  fit great with out going in my ears very high quality would definitely recommend", "Very great quality! The sound is amazing.  Very comfortable and strong battery life.","One of my gripes sometimes with earphones that are not in-ear is that they don't give you the same quality of sound and the same experience. However, in-ear earphones don't work for me. Constantly falling out, hurting my ear, etc. These are a welcome change. The hook around the ear ensures they are stable and won't fall out (I have tested this by shaking my head like a crazy person). I do have smaller ears than most people so I was very skeptical that the other part would fit, but it does. I do have a little discomfort but I think that will change as I get used to them. Overall, I recommend these."], "reference": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,0], "score": [0.8999999761581421, 0.5, 0.8999999761581421, 0.8999999761581421, 0.8999999761581421, 0.8999999761581421, 0.800000011920929, 0.8999999761581421,-0.20000000298023224]}
