{"reviews": ["The motor for this vacuum is AC. AC motors tend to be a bit louder and not quite as efficient or enduring as DC Brushless motors, which are a more recent invention and can be found in other cordless handheld vacuums, but they typically have higher price points. It takes approximate 3.5 HRs to charge this vacuum from empty (red) to full (green). Cleaning out these types of vacuums is always challenging since a lot of dust/particles get stuck to the paper filters, as opposed to getting trapped into the plastic collector cup. This means you have to actually pick the very debris you've vacuumed up out of the filter with your bear hands (I don't recommend using a brush or water, at least not often, as it will quickly degrade the paper filters, and you only get two of them and I've already contacted the seller about getting more filters and it seems as though it's not possible). It comes with two attachments, a crevice tool and an upholstery brush. The vacuum has a sleek design that will fit in with any decor and can be stored, along with the attachments, on a stand that charges it."], "reference": [2], "score": [0.182]}
