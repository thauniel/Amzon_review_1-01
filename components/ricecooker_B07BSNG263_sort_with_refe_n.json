{"reviews": ["I‚Äôm shocked that someone could sell a product in the US with instructions that are filled with spelling and grammatical errors. The makers didn‚Äôt even bother having someone proof read it. Oh, aside from these errors they also make no sense!<br /><br />Here‚Äôs what I learned by trial and error:<br />(1) for up to 4 cups of rice, use a half cup more of water ex. 3 cups rice to 3.5 cups water. For over 4 cups of rice, use one cup more water ex. 5 cups rice, 6 cups water.<br />(2) for 4 cups of rice I use 1/3 cup of oil. Whatever you do, do not go by their recommended oil usage of whatever this thing ‚Äúsalad oil‚Äù is called. You‚Äôll end up with super oily rice! I use half blend of avocado and olive oil which is a pale colored oil and not super heavy. Works great.<br />(3) I cook 4 cups of rice for 60-min and the tahdig (crispy bottom) comes out perfectly.<br />* Add 20 more minutes for more than 4 cups<br />* Do not stir the rice, you‚Äôll break it and it won‚Äôt come out perfectly. Maybe one light stir but no more is needed.<br />(4) when there‚Äôs about 10 minutes left and you don‚Äôt see any more water, pour in your saffron<br /><br />The lid does not have a rubber seal so the whole time it whistles which can definitely be improved upon. Other than that it works once you actually get the hang of it.", "Look at other brand rice cooker, you will be happier. I have two other rice cooker from different brand and they have been working fine for almost twelve years.  the reason I bout this one was because the large 15 cups( which is not really able to cook 15 cups of rice, it is just enough for 10 cups)I bought this on July of 2015, and after about two months later used it for the first time, but realized that the on and off automatic timer system did not work. The rice cooker kept working and working no matter which time I put it on. I had to plug off the cooker in order to stop it from cooking. first rice dish came out burned in the bottom and second one was good because I unplugged it on time.The cooker was new out of box, but broken. It should not be sold with electronic malfunction. I called the manufactory and talked to the owner's son. I explained everything to him. He said that he will talk to his dad the owner of the company and will get back to me. He took all my information, but have not heard from him for almost 10 months. I even left another message  reminder for him, but nothing was done about it.", "I was excited about purchasing the PARS Persian Rice Cooker but when I used it for the first time I realized that the rice to water ratio from the directions that came with the cooker were not correct, the rice was dry and hard.  I played with the water ratio and the rice came out much better.  You will need to add more water then the directions say.", "When the rice is boiling the froth overflows. The lid must be put on half way open. After the water evaporates, it should be closed all the way for the rice to simmer right.", "It doesn't work that well when making the maximum number of cups of rice. Rice comes out mushy and sticky.", "Size is well overstated. First of all I rcd. a 4 cup cooker instead of a 5 cup cooker. And even as a 4 cup cooker it is so small I would call it a 2 cups cooker.The cup that it comes with is close to 1/2 a cup capacity. I am sending it back right away so I don't know how well it works. Will order a 10 cup cooker maybe it will do. I am an old timer in cooking rice. you need a lot of free space for rice to cook in as it expands and need room for steam. I am grading it a two star for the hassle and inaccuracy in description.", "I am so frustrated. I bought a five cup rice cooker thinking I could cook three cups of rice with 1.5 cups of lentils or whatever other kind of veggies for polo. There is no way this rice cooker will hold five cups of rice once it's cooked. First of all, the cup that comes with it is smaller than an average cup and they tell you to use that. And even if three of those small cups more than doubles in size (as rice does when you cook it), I find it hard to imagine that all the rice will fit in this rice cooker. Forget about making five cups of rice. Definitely go up a size- or 2- bigger than you want! Plus the instructions don't make sense as they were written by someone who doesn't know much English. I have no idea what the timer instructions say. I've read them five times. I'm returning this item. üò°", "This rice cooker has not been redesigned for over 40 years... I'd recommend \"Yum Asia Sakura Rice Cooker with Ceramic Bowl and Advanced Fuzzy Logic (8 Cup, 1.5 Litre) 6 Rice Cook Functions, 6 Multicook Functions, Motouch LED Display, 120V Power\" instead. It has many other functionalities like slow cook, sitkcy rice, soup, etc. It also makes great tadig!<br /><br />I bought this from a local Persian store but it's the same product and this review applies to all of them.<br /><br />This rice cooker should not have ever been made or sold and I'll explain why:<br /><br />Someone at Pars decided to expand the line without having to do a little R&D. They probably hired a Persian guy and a Polish dude, had them cut the top of a 10 cup rice cooker, shrunk the inner pot, made it thinner and called it a day without calibrating the burner.<br /><br />The burner was never designed for smaller than a 10 cup rice cooker and it runs at the same temperature and intervals. An smaller, thinner inner pot cannot dissipate and distribute the heat as fast as it should and for that reason it burns the rice every time. If you can smell the Teflon melting, that's too hot. It's dangerous to operate and dangerous to eat out of. Most of you who posted the pictures of your tadig, they are burned... if you see a black ring in the middle of brown, that's burned tadig.<br /><br />Do not buy smaller than 10 cup Pars rice cooker until this is fixed. A 10 cup is not much bigger but still cooks one or two cups better than the smaller capacity rice cooker Pars makes.", "It does what it says it'll do. I wanted the lovely crust, and it gives the lovely crust. The instructions are in ridiculous English, but making rice is not rocket science, so I won't judge it on the quality of its instructions.", "It came with a stainless steel looking lid instead of glass that they have in the picture. The stainless steel color of the rice cooker is different than the lid. They don't even match!! Little black metal particles fall from the lid on top of your rice, its dangerous to use, don't buy it!", "I‚Äôve only had this rice cooker for one month and the knob does not work well. The bottom rice (tadig) comes out burned since the knob gets stuck and doesn‚Äôt count down. The rice is not fully cooked, when it says complete.", "Have had rice cookers used more often and last for a very long time.  This one was used not as often since we didnt go through that much rice any longer .Even the one this one replaced was still working but we liked that this made Tahdig so we decided to buy one for us and my son. Ours out of the blue not even 5 yrs and it heats but not enough to cook rice. At 3x the cost of other rice cookers this should last at least as long if not longer. That's why the review.", "Disappointing, not like how it describes it instead half the rice becomes thick hard hardly golden thin crispy  for such an expensive person rice cooker I don‚Äôt even want to give one star also I use the best rice , no aroma no taste üëéüèª Terrible rice cooker will be returning .", "You get Crispy rice at the bottom alright,  but at what cost...... the electric pot suppose to boil the water+oil+salt first, then you add the rice and only then the timer should start countdown, but that is not what happened. The timer start fro: beginning and continue until th3 end. also when the rice is in there and it reach boil point, the whole mix boils over and out of the lid.... at the end of it all the rice ‚Äúcake‚Äù sticks to the pan unless you saturates the dish with so much oil.... when I use their measurement the rice came out mooshy, which by the way their one cup of rice is really 3/4 of a cup or 2/3 of a cup. After the first few failures I changed amounts to see if that will do any good, but it came oily and burned or dry to the crisp... instructions are totally off! I did get kind of a nice rice cake at one time, but again the rice on top was too soft and the bottom was too oily... I am still looking for the one who will be more accurate... also, there is no way to alternate recipes like having potatoes at the bottom etc. hopefully someone will come with something better... sooner then later....", "1. Very poor build quality. Electrical switch fell apart after a few months of use. Screw on the cover handle came off. The tread was stripped, so it could not be re-assembled.<br /><br />2. Poorly written instructions. If I didn‚Äôt know how to make Persian rice myself, I would be lost following the instructions.", "This rice needs to be precooked beforehand otherwise it won't cook very well.", "An attractive rice cooker but am a little disappointed in its functionality as it does not cook the rice thoroughly. Instructions very poorly put together.", "I bought this product less than a year ago, and now its not even warming the water let alone making the rice.  IT should have lasted a lot more than barely a year.  How can I get a replacement for this product?", "The rice cooker is burning the rice.  I followed the youtube video.  She put the dial to 60 mins.  When I did this the rice was black and inedible.  I even tried 20 mins and it still burnt.", "This product is excellent if you like rice with a crunchy top.<br />I wanted a bigger rice cooker and the Amazon returns policy on this item is impossible. I cant return this because of inadequate return information from Amazon. I have lost ¬£109, I hope Amazon read this", "It never did work properly, I always thought this is the way it works. And my Persian friend told me this rice cooker is nonfunctioning doesn‚Äôt cook the rice right.<br />I would like to get a replacement with the ones that he works.", "I am not satisfied with the rice cooker it burns the rice ."], "reference": [28, 6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "score": [-0.018750000395812094, -0.30000001192092896, -0.2500000037252903, -0.10000000149011612, -0.10000000149011612, -0.02500000037252903, -0.02400000035762787, -0.4000000059604645, -0.10000000149011612, -0.4000000059604645, -0.30000001192092896, -0.2000000085681677, -0.30000001192092896, -0.08163265427764581, -0.10000000149011612, -0.4000000059604645, -0.5, -0.5, -0.3250000048428774, -0.10000000149011612, -0.10000000149011612, -0.800000011920929]}
