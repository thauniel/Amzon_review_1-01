{"reviews": ["Overall the head phones are good. I’m very picky about getting a good deep bass sound. Even when Adjusted EQ I wasn’t happy.  I’m a musician and a bass player. They were easy to operate and connect to my phone and tablet.", "The sound on this is very tinny, even when I've played around with the EQ quite a bit.<br />The base is almost non-existent.<br />I've turned the noise cancelling on and off and can't really tell any difference"], "reference": [4, 0], "score": [-0.6000000238418579, -0.30000001192092896]}
