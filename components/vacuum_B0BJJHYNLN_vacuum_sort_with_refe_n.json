{"reviews": ["Hand held vacuum that is not very strong. Vacuum has weak suction that will only do light surface cleanup, will not do any deep cleaning like a higher power vacuum would do. For a simple spill, it will probably work, but if you want it to vacuum up deep debris, it just does not have the suction power to do it. Price point is considered high for no more power than it has.", "This can hold it's own with similar name brand handvacs, for a fraction of the cost. It is about half the size of a Dustbuster.*<br /><br />Charged by any USB port or wall wart, this handvac is compact, QUIET and powerful. The USB cable has an LED which is red when charging and green when fully charged. The engrish manual says not to use the vacuum while charging.  I imagine the concern is breaking the port where the charging cable plugs into the vac (I tested it, it works fine plugged in).<br /><br />Comes with a bunch of attachments, but I primarily use the crevice tool. It fits under most car seats, and can be easily secreted away in an office drawer so you can have it at the ready to suck up embarrassing Cheeto dust from your keyboard or evict wasps from the window.<br /><br />*Apparently some other reviewers did not realize that THIS IS NOT A SHOP-VAC, nor is it marketed as such."], "reference": [1, 0], "score": [-0.20000000298023224, -0.20000000298023224]}
