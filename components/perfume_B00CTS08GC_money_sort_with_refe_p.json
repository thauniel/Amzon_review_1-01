{"reviews": ["I was skeptical but I bought it anyway bc it's so much cheaper than AF Fierce. Came in yesterday and it's identical to Fierce. I'm not sure how long the smell will last but as far as the fragrance though, it's a dead on match. Glad I found this before I spent a ton of money of the real thing. If you're looking to save money but want the Fierce smell, go ahead and get this.  I've worn Fierce for the past 10 years and I'll buy this from now on."], "reference": [2], "score": [0.30000000074505806]}
