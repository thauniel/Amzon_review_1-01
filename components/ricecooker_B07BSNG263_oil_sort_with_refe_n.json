{"reviews": ["You get Crispy rice at the bottom alright,  but at what cost...... the electric pot suppose to boil the water+oil+salt first, then you add the rice and only then the timer should start countdown, but that is not what happened. The timer start fro: beginning and continue until th3 end. also when the rice is in there and it reach boil point, the whole mix boils over and out of the lid.... at the end of it all the rice “cake” sticks to the pan unless you saturates the dish with so much oil.... when I use their measurement the rice came out mooshy, which by the way their one cup of rice is really 3/4 of a cup or 2/3 of a cup. After the first few failures I changed amounts to see if that will do any good, but it came oily and burned or dry to the crisp... instructions are totally off! I did get kind of a nice rice cake at one time, but again the rice on top was too soft and the bottom was too oily... I am still looking for the one who will be more accurate... also, there is no way to alternate recipes like having potatoes at the bottom etc. hopefully someone will come with something better... sooner then later....", "I made the rice according to the directions, the timer goes to 60 minutes and the directions don't say how many minutes you should use. I tried 60 minutes the first time and had to turn off the rice cooker before the end because it was burning.  The second time I used 40 minutes and still got some burnt spots. Also the amount of oil they recommend is too much, the tahdig came out super oily"], "reference": [0, 0], "score": [-0.07500000111758709, -0.5]}
